    "description": "# Doxy Replacment shell\n\nA replacement shell for the original Doxy Massager.\n\nThis is work in progress, I haven't come round to printing it yet. There probably will be some updates to the design once I've don the first test print.\n\n# Known issues\n\nThe design doesn't have smooth curves like the original, as I don't know yet how to do that in OpenSCAD. I'm open to suggestions.\nThus you have to replace both halves of the original shell, even if only one is broken.\n\n# License\n\nThis project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0).\n\n# Source\n\nThe [source of this model](https://github.com/nomike/doxy-replacement-shell) can be found on GitHub.",
