A replacement shell for the original Doxy Massager.

This is work in progress, I haven't come round to printing it yet. There probably will be some updates to the design once I've don the first test print.

#### Known issues

The design doesn't have smooth curves like the original, as I don't know yet how to do that in OpenSCAD. I'm open to suggestions.
Thus you have to replace both halves of the original shell, even if only one is broken.
