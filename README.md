***WARNING:** This is still work in progress. The measurements are off. I printed this once and it
didn't fit yet. I will update this once I have a working version.*

A replacement shell for the original Doxy Massager.

More information and deatils about the design as well as instructions for printing and assembly can
be found in <doxy-replacement-shell-v2.scad>.

#### Additional material needed

I tried hard to not require any material except for this print, but had to add one M3 hex nut.
But you can get them easily in every hardware store.
